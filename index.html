    <p>I am a very Outgoing and detail-oriented, energetic and fun to be with guy. I am very proficient at building and oiling professional relationships, I learn very fast. I communicate clearly and concisely. I have associate degree in accounting and currently attending Case Wester Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. </p>
    <p>In our current world where everything is becoming virtual, I envisaged that one of the professions that will take over the universe, if not the only one, is information technology. Thus, I have taken the challenge to equip myself with what it takes to function better in that world by learning web development. News reporting, Sales, Marketing, Health, Schools and whatever you can think of, is moving from the conventional ways of doing them to online. Therefore, I decided to throw my cap into the ring of web development.</p>
